So long term it‚Äôs not going to be exactly 3x because if semis have a bad day, week, month, etc., you‚Äôre taking 3x worse performance on those time periods too. 

To me personally, maybe a good comparison is looking at this etf versus NVDA over March 2020 to now. Nvda is +700% while SOXL is +1,400% or so. So definitely juiced to the upside but partially offset by larger drawdowns on bad days.

Turns out they were lying and Evergrande didn't pay shit.

All it would take is a slight reduction of guidance to basically cut the stock in half.  That's what happened with DOCU; beat on Q3 but reduced guidance moving forward.

CHWY is probably the more obvious one given its a online retailer for pets and a more meme name.

DKNG burns huge amounts of cash, there's tons of competition, and NY is taking 51% which will make profits impossible and gives states precedent to increase their cut.  If states get bigger cuts, DKNG's margins will get crushed.  Profitability for DKNG may not occur until 2025 or beyond.  With their cash burn, they may eventually have to offer shares to make sure they have enough cash buffer.  There's just too low of a barrier to entry into the market.

Viva-La-Pepe,0.0,"I'm bullish on FUBO. I use it for the wheel. I'm down on my current position, but my YTD for FUBO is still positive overall.

Based on what I have read, FUBO's plan is to cover gaps in revenue with the emerging legalized sports betting industry. While there is going to be a lot of competition, I feel that people who subscribe to FUBO are naturally going to use FUBO for their sports betting.  FUBO also wants to bring European style sports betting where you can place wagers to events during the game in real time.

The main gap in FUBO right now is the Turner Network channels TNT &amp; TBS. FUBO Says they are just charging to damn much. The execs at FUBO hope that having features other streaming services do not, like split screen and cloud recording, will compensate for not having TNT &amp; TBS in the short term.

In the long term, they feel that Turner will either come down in price as they leverage their going number of subscribers, or the Turner/AT&amp;T/Warner network will simply go bust and the channels will be sold off to other networks. They are already sold off the famous CNN Atlanta HQ to a new owner and CNN will be run by Discovery in some sort of complicated new deal.",1637504495.0,1.0

PlsDontNuke,0.0,"&gt; Did you get a 1600 on your SAT?

Can't remember, I guess I might have? I only took a practice test in middle school without studying for it though, I never got far enough in school to take the real SAT 

&gt; Are you a musical prodigy or write a hit song?

Musical prodigy, yes, at least if lyrics count. Pretty good at some instruments too but not exactly prodigal 

&gt; Are you a brilliant chef?

Cook yes, chef no

&gt; Have you invented anything

On paper yes, still working on obtaining the resources for realization. None of my realized inventions so far have any significance 

&gt; sewn anything

Yes

&gt; or done anything with your hands besides jerk off?

Yes

&gt; The only thing worse than a smart annoying nerd is a foolish stupid one. You‚Äôre the smartest person you know because you live in a bubble among barely literate mediocre tiny penis men and that doesn‚Äôt make you smart.

Ok but I still wish there were other people as ""smart"" (or as much less stupid than average) as me, or at least that I could find them. It would be nice to have someone I could always rely on for a useful second opinion, someone I can put two heads together with. And it would be AMAZING to find a woman like that and start a family with her. Too amazing to describe. But I feel like if there's a God he might have prohibited me from ever being allowed to have that as punishment for how when I was a kid I took that kind of stuff for granted and truly believed what I needed to be happy was to be the best person, when it turns out trying to be the best person is horribly lonely and succeeding would be unbearable. Just succeeding in the intelligence aspect is pretty unbearable. 

&gt; Change rooms then or continue self aggrandizing.

I'll take continuing to self aggrandize since I don't want all known life to go extinct and I still haven't reached the capability of preventing it. Why would I pick the ""change rooms"" option? What does that even mean, just assume there's an afterlife full of smart people and kill myself? Super retarded dichotomy",1637159027.0,1.0

bcdnabd,0.0,"If our government can find a way to tax the untaxable (offshore accounts, art, etc...) then they should do that. But they're called tax shelters for a reason. The way the tax code is written, the super wealthy aren't doing anything wrong.  They've just discovered ways to 'cheat' the system.  The only answer there is to totally rewrite the tax codes.  
BUT, if the tax codes are rewritten so unfavorably towards the Uber wealthy, they will pack up their belongings (and their companies and all of the good jobs those companies provide to American citizens) and move to a more favorable country, where they and their companies will pay less in taxes. And those countries will be extremely happy to welcome our billionaires, probably even providing them with tax subsidies for the first few years while transitioning to the new country. It's been happening here (many California companies moving to more favorable Texas) for a few years now. 
So, I still assert that we have more of a spending problem than a taxation problem. Of all the money printed in the United States in over 240 years, 40% of that money was printed last year. Tell me again how we don't have a spending problem.",1636994812.0,1.0

getBusyChild,0.0,"&gt;U.S. consumer prices rose last month at the fastest annual pace since 1990, cementing high inflation as a hallmark of the pandemic recovery and eroding spending power even as wages surge.

&gt;The consumer price index increased 6.2% from October 2020, according to Labor Department data released Wednesday. The CPI rose 0.9% from September, the largest advance in four months. Both advances exceeded all estimates in a Bloomberg survey of economists.

&gt;Higher prices for energy, shelter, food and vehicles fueled the supercharged reading and indicated inflation is broadening out beyond categories associated with reopening.

&gt;Stock futures dropped after the report, while the yield on the 10-year Treasury rose and the dollar strengthened.

&gt;Against a backdrop of solid demand, businesses have been steadily raising prices for consumer goods and services at the same time supply chain bottlenecks and a shortage of qualified workers drive up costs.

&gt;**Fed Pressure**

&gt;The pickup suggests higher inflation will be longer-lasting than previously thought, putting pressure on Federal Reserve officials to end near-zero interest rates sooner than expected and potentially to quicken the pace of the bond-buying taper announced last week.

&gt;The data also threaten to exacerbate political challenges for President Joe Biden and Democrats as they seek to pass a nearly $2 trillion tax-and-spending package and defend razor-thin congressional majorities in next year‚Äôs midterm elections.

&gt;A report on Tuesday showed prices paid to U.S. producers also accelerated last month, largely due to higher goods costs, and adding to concerns about persistent price pressures across the globe. 

&gt;In China, inflation at the factory level last month increased by the most in 26 years, while consumer prices in Brazil sped up by more than forecast.

&gt;Excluding the volatile food and energy components, so-called core inflation rose 0.6% from the prior month and 4.2% from a year earlier. The annual increase was the largest since 1991.

&gt;Shelter costs -- which are considered to be a more structural component of the CPI and make up about a third of the overall index -- rose 0.5% in October, the most in four months as higher rents and home prices feed into the data. The cost of hotel stays increased.

&gt;Prices for new cars rose 1.4% last month as a global shortage of semiconductors continues to limit inventories and drive up costs. Used-vehicle prices jumped 2.5%.

&gt;Americans are also facing higher costs for basic necessities:
*Food up 5.3% from year ago, most since January 2009
*Gasoline rose 6.1% from September, biggest gain since March
*Electricity costs jumped 1.8%, largest monthly increase since 2014
*Fuel oil advanced 12.3% from prior month, most since 2007

&gt;**Through the Company Lens**

&gt;‚ÄúWe haven‚Äôt seen, I‚Äôll say, any more resistance to our price increases than we‚Äôve seen historically.‚Äù -- McDonald‚Äôs Corp. CFO Kevin Ozan, Oct. 27 earnings call

&gt;‚ÄúLooking at Q4, we expect our selling price actions to continue to gain traction, as we work to mitigate the raw material and logistics inflationary pressures we have experienced throughout the year.‚Äù -- 3M Co. CFO Monish Patolawala, Oct. 26 earnings call

&gt;‚ÄúWe feel very comfortable that any inflation that is affecting our margin today, we have the ability to offset it.‚Äù -- Chipotle Mexican Grill Inc. CFO John Hartung, Oct. 21 earnings call

&gt;‚ÄúWe have now announced pricing in nine out of ten categories, so very broad based.‚Äù -- Procter &amp; Gamble Co. CFO Andre Schulten, Oct. 19 earnings call

&gt;While most CPI categories rose, the cost of airfares declined for a fourth month and apparel prices were unchanged.

&gt;Wages have strengthened markedly in recent months -- with some measures rising by the most on record -- but higher consumer prices are eroding Americans‚Äô buying power. 

&gt;Inflation-adjusted average hourly earnings fell 1.2% in October from a year earlier, separate data showed Wednesday.",1636554233.0,3.0

Partially due to the large amount of imported pharmaceuticals and medical tech that is priced way above what it should, but alot of it is due to greed as well. More tax dollars can definitely help with alot of the problems but again, fighting corruption would help more, but that's far more difficult than just introducing some new bills. And while elons payment alone is just a drop in the bucket he is a single person which would make up 1.4% of the total military budget in a country of 330 million. We have alot of billionaires and combined that would be a huge boost in tax revenue.

AutoModerator,0.0,"Michael Burry responded to my craigslist ad looking for someone to mow my lawn. ""$30 is $30"", he said as he continued to mow what was clearly the wrong yard. My neighbor and I shouted at him but he was already wearing muffs. Focused dude. He attached a phone mount onto the handle of his push mower. I was able to sneak a peak and he was browsing zillow listings in central Wyoming. He wouldn't stop cackling.

That is to say, Burry has his fingers in a lot of pies. He makes sure his name is in all the conversations.

InIce1234,0.0,"He has to do some paperwork with the SEC. It takes about 6 months until he is able to sell. I is likely that some investment bank is going to sell for him. Transactions are going to be over several days and will be done as a closing cross trade. Closing cross trades have almost no impact on the stock price. Further some of Elons options will expire 8/13/2022. He can buy 22,862,050 shares at $6.24 each. 

TLDR 

Elon is going to sell some stocks only to be able to buy even more stocks trough his options. Very bullish. Buy the dip.

It costs 0,69‚Ç¨ which is 0.80$.

The stock costs 19.29$ ATM.

So, doesn't an option give me the right to buy 100 stocks for the strike price (here 12$) in the time from now until the expiration date (here 16.12.22)? If so, what stops me from buying the option for 0.8$ and executing it to buy 100 stocks for 12$ and then sell them for a profit.

I am sure that this is not how it works. But where is my mistake? Sry, new to options and all that stuff. Thanks for you help! :)",1636208549.0,1.0

 &gt;Wealth inequality in the United States, also known as the wealth gap, is the unequal distribution of assets among residents of the United States. Wealth commonly includes the values of any homes, automobiles, personal valuables, businesses, savings, and investments, as well as any associated debts. As of Q3 2019, the top 10% of households held 70% of the country's wealth, while the bottom 50% held 2%. From an international perspective, the difference in US median and mean wealth per adult is over 600%.

whatkindpinetrees,0.0,"The driverless taxi business is at least a decade away. We have dinosaurs running our government and people fear new things, FSD will have to be much much safer than a human driver and have years of testing before true driverless cars are legal. But when it happens you are right people in cities would probably choose to taxi everywhere instead of purchase a car. Tesla could create an Uber like app to summon taxis and take a cut for every trip from drivers, or Tesla could pump taxis directly to the streets and take the full cut for every trip. Tesla may reach 20million cars/ year in 10 years then it may start to decline due to driverless taxis but their revenue will continue to grow due to income from rides. Also demand for driverless cars would be so high initially that profit margins will skyrocket example Musk has always said the price of FSD will rocket up when tech is proven. Last point is thinking outside of the USA many third world countries are barely getting a large population of people able to afford a car and infrastructure in those countries won‚Äôt be ready for FSD for many years to come. My bet is Tesla becomes #1 car manufacturer in the world stock price fluctuates between $500-$1000 for a decade then moons when Tesla delivers true FSD.",1634826147.0,1.0

Cautious_Cat_9918,0.0,I think your forgetting the rest of the world exists and It makes economic sense to operate the way we do for the benefit  of our country/s and it‚Äôs people who are willing to put in the work. We could devalue our currency to make American made products attractive to foreign markets but we‚Äôve developed a very lucrative niche in the international economy that is much more profitable for the average citizen. If your living in a first world country your the 1%. The 99% of people who don‚Äôt have that luxury would gladly work twice as hard as you at a physical job so that one day they or their kids can end up pushing numbers around. I think most people would rather have the opportunity to sit in an air conditioned office  with daily Uber eats delivery‚Äôs and great pay and nice neighborhoods which comes from not having to work on a factory line.,1634393820.0,1.0

Fat_Sassy_Classy,0.0,"So let‚Äôs take a look at the options:

Approximately 12 million shares represented across the entire option chain from $4-$10.5

Daily volume average is approx 26 million. So any options pressure to the upside is going to be muted by those taking profits. We‚Äôre looking at price swings measured in cents‚Äî unless it‚Äôs the EOW gamma. We just want the options to take us into the right area by the middle of week. The biggest position out there in the local area is already hedged for, so your just gonna see increased amplitude around $8. $10, 12, 14 are the next biggest positions and are completely unhedged. Nice step up if bears let the price run.

The first point of significant gamma is between $8.5 and $9, so that‚Äôs should be the range where a squeeze would start if you see one, but the delta windows all starting to tighten, So anything shy of $8.3 by Thursday is gonna turn into inverse pressure and tank the price back down as options are dehedged.

Tl;dr
We want 8.5 by Wednesday and $9 by Thursday or expect a sell off EOW.",1633962202.0,2.0

My second time watching the first season of it, I had a hunch it might actually be so good my mom could enjoy it even though she's in her 50s and is neither into video games nor anime, because the story and characters are so good and a lot of the gamer humor is based enough in general internet culture that any boomer with social media could understand it pretty well. When I showed it to her to test my hunch and see if Sword Art Online Abridged would really be good enough for her to find it relatable or compelling, what I did not expect was after the first season was over she was writing fan mail to the creators applauding their work. I don't rank it as the best anime of all time, for me that would be Trigun which is also the most perfect story of all time in general, but you probably can't go wrong with SAO:A if you liked SAO",1633270999.0,1.0

Then they would cut all the red tape that they put in place in order to streamline the process of running these containers through customs. Then they would all go on tv to tell us all how hard they worked and how fabulous of a job they did saving the world by simply getting rid of all the roadblocks they put in the way in the first place. Keep in mind our ports are like airports so to speak. Everything has to go through homeland security. Every part of the process is unionized and most likely a cumbersome process on paper.

Meanwhile the PPC, our most extreme right party has gained some traction but it‚Äôs mainly from courting the anti-lockdown anti-vaccine groups that even our Conservative party refuses to pander to. I honestly don‚Äôt see them being nearly as strong without COVID making things easy for them to draw in extremists. 

It‚Äôs a little concerning but honestly most Canadians still support progressive ideas. Also our political scene and media is a lot less polarizing than the US. People are far more levelheaded and less about my team vs your team. It‚Äôs totally normal for people to switch between liberal and conservative depending on the season and their needs.

PlsDontNuke,0.0,"If you've actually inversed yourself and it worked, it's because you used your brain computer to run an AI trading bot instead of your own thought processes and feelings. Rather than relying on your natural intelligence, you took natural biases out of the equation, literally ignoring your most naturally inclined conclusions, and instead artificially simulating a different kind of thinker with a different kind of thought process. ""Inversing yourself"" doesn't mean you randomly got a message from god to do the opposite of what you want to do, it means algorithms you've constructed mentally have shown you a possibility to do something that seems like it shouldn't work and you're choosing to let some money ride on the conclusion of that algorithm rather than your own guess. 

And since you're using your brain as the computer to run this AI, it can just absorb the program into your natural intelligence if the results are positive. The concept you're testing goes from feeling like an algorithm you're letting some money ride on instead of your own guess, to just being another part of your brain's normal process of guessing.

Inversing yourself sounds retarded but actually doing it is pretty smart and a good way to learn imo",1632320573.0,1.0
